                    <p>My name is Adrian Moravec. I am new to the coding world and am excited to learn the ropes at this Boot Camp course.</p>

                    <p>I grew up in a small town of 6,000 in Nebraska and moved to attend school in Minneapolis. I graduated from Augsburg College with a double major in Music and Film. I then went on to study and obtain a Master's Degree in Film Journalism at the University of Scotland.</p>
        
                    <p>I have two lovely (if aggravatingly difficult to put to sleep) kids aged 2 and 4 and been married for nearly twelve years. After working various retail jobs I currently teach private piano and guitar lessons at Beacon Academy in Crystal.</p>

                    <p>I currently reside in Brooklyn Park, MN where I watch as many movies as I possibly can and try to find time to cook and bake (particularly cookies).</p>
